Changes:

* Added an extension of time series detection (absorbance-cube-detector and fluorescence-cube-detector)
  * Reasoning: Extension adopted in order to capture metadata about the originating computer system, software, file, and ASM conversion
  * Proposal: add "absorbance cube detector"  and "fluorescence-cube-detector" to the current plate reader schema.
