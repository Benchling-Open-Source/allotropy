Base schema: None

The most recent schema for cell culture analyzers is http://purl.allotrope.org/json-schemas/adm/cell-culture-analyzer/REC/2021/12/cell-culture-analyzer.schema, and is quite out of date with the more modern schemas that implement "measurement aggregate document"

This is a proposed new schema for cell culture analyzers that is more in line with these more modern schemas.
