The parsers follow maturation levels of: Recommended, Candidate Release, Working Draft.

* Recommended - "General Availability" - the parser has good coverage of input formats, and exports the majority of data from source files.
** Note that while we judge release status based on observed use cases, it is still a judgement call - it is still possible that we miss some cases.
** If you have an example case for an instrument that is not supported or discover a bug, please https://github.com/Benchling-Open-Source/allotropy/issues[open an issue] with sample data and will work to add support!
* Candidate Release - "Limited Availability" - the parser exports correct data for supported cases, but may be missing some functionality, including:
** May not handle all possible input formats from the target instrument software (because they have not been seen before).
** May not export all available data from the input, either because it cannot be supported yet by ASM, or because we have not determined how to add it.
** Increased likelihood of bugs due to lack of "bake time" for discovering issues.
* Working Draft - "Beta" - in development, not ready for production use:
** May be missing enough sample data for us to be confident about correctness of parser
** May be in-progress, with signifcant known TODO work
